## Overview

- **Aim**: to research the *short-term* effects of childhood exposures to non-persistent EDCs on neurodevelopment in childhood, and how the metabolome **might** *mediate* these effects.
- **How**: by making use of the principles and criteria of triangulation.
- **Population**: the HELIX sub-cohort, consisting of $\text{N}=1200$ mother-child pairs.
- **Exposures**: non-persistent EDCs (phenols, phthalates, and organophosphate compounds), measured in childhood in a pool of two urine samples.
- **Outcome**: Attention Network Test, to provide a measure of the efficiency of three different functions of attention.
- ***Mediators***: urine metabolites (focus on corticosteroids).

## The Research Questions

  exposure(chemical) --> mediator(metabolite)
  mediator --> outcome(neurodevelopment)
  exposure --> outcome
```

Issues and limitations:

- The effect of exposure to these chemicals on neurodevelopment has been studied already, although there are clear issues with that study (e.g., wrong model, DAG **not** tailored to the exposures of interest).
- The effect of exposure to these chemicals on these **newly** measured metabolites could be identifiable, although they were measured in the same samples. This question poses some challenges since they were all measured in urine (inter-individual variability in urine dilution).
- The effect of these **newly** measured metabolites on neurodevelopment could be identifiable, since they were measure in the urine samples (\textcolor{red}{which aliquot?}) collected before the visit.

## Current setup

Variables:

- Clinical outcome: Attention Network Test (`hs_hitrtse`, Hit Reaction Time Standard Error).

Methods:

- Weights estimation (`chemical ~ covariates`): energy balancing.
- Effect estimation (`outcome ~ chemical + covariates`): `glm` with natural splines for exposure.

## Population description: correlations

![Correlation numerical variables.](artwork/corr.png)

## Preliminary results: weights

```{r}
targets::tar_load(c("weights", 
                    "weighted_fits", 
                    "marginal"), 
                  store = paste0(
                    "~/mounts/rstudioserver/PROJECTES/HELIX_OMICS/",  
                    "DATA_PREVIOUS_MIGRATION/lorenzoF/", 
                    "data/data_paper3/_targets/_targetsRQ2/"
                  ))
```

## Preliminary results: weighted G-computation

- Marginal effects of exposure to non-persistent EDCs on Cortisone: comparison `Q3 - Q1`.

## Next steps

- Dealing with creatinine.

![Comparison of effect estimation.](artwork/comp_creatinineAdj.png)

- Developing a more appropriate pipeline to deal with censored exposures and metabolites.

- Dealing with more appropriate modeling strategies?

  - `lmtp` will be the focus of my research stay (*Mixtures done right*) under the supervision of Prof. Jessica G. Young and Prof. Ivan Diaz (who formalized causal identification of interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment).
