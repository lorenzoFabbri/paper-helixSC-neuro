## Overview

- **Aim**: to research the *short-term* effects of childhood exposures to non-persistent EDCs on neurodevelopment in childhood, and how the metabolome **might** *mediate* these effects.
- **How**: by making use of the principles and criteria of triangulation.
- **Population**: the HELIX sub-cohort, consisting of $\text{N}=1200$ mother-child pairs.
- **Exposures**: non-persistent EDCs (phenols, phthalates, and organophosphate compounds), measured in childhood in a pool of two urine samples.
- **Outcome**: Attention Network Test, to provide a measure of the efficiency of three different functions of attention.
- ***Mediators***: urine metabolites (focus on corticosteroids).

## The Research Questions

  exposure --> outcome
```

Issues and limitations:

- The effect of exposure to these chemicals on neurodevelopment has been studied already, although there are clear issues with that study (e.g., wrong model, DAG **not** tailored to the exposures of interest).
- The effect of exposure to these chemicals on these **newly** measured metabolites could be identifiable, although they were measured in the same samples. This question poses some challenges since they were all measured in urine (inter-individual variability in urine dilution).
- The effect of these **newly** measured metabolites on neurodevelopment could be identifiable, since they were measure in the urine samples (\textcolor{red}{which aliquot?}) collected before the visit.

## Current setup

Variables:

- Clinical outcome: Attention Network Test (`hs_hitrtse`, Hit Reaction Time Standard Error).

Methods:

- Weights estimation (`chemical ~ covariates`): energy balancing.
- Effect estimation (`outcome ~ chemical + covariates`): `glm` with natural splines for exposure.
