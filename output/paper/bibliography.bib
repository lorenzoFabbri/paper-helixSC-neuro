  abstract = {We use the term “ratio problem” to describe the omitted variable and measurement error bias that can arise when a ratio is the dependent variable in a statistical model. First, we show how bias can arise from the omission of two classes of variables based on a ratio’s denominator. Second, we show how measurement error in the ratio’s denominator can produce bias. We use an important finding in economics (the “inverse U” relationship between managerial ownership and Tobin’s Q) as an example to show how results can be reversed when omitted variables are included. We show that this risk of bias is pervasive across disciplines, including in public health, where we demonstrate that the relationship between control measures in China and the incidence of COVID19 is reversed when the ratio problem is addressed. We provide empirical tests and solutions to the ratio problem, and urge caution when applied researchers use ratios as dependent variables.},

  abstract = {Objective: Interest in candidate gene and candidate gene-by-environment interaction hypotheses regarding major depressive disorder remains strong despite controversy surrounding the validity of previous findings. In response to this controversy, the present investigation empirically identified 18 candidate genes for depression that have been studied 10 or more times and examined evidence for their relevance to depression phenotypes. Methods: Utilizing data from large population-based and case-control samples (Ns ranging from 62,138 to 443,264 across subsamples), the authors conducted a series of preregistered analyses examining candidate gene polymorphism main effects, polymorphism-by-environment interactions, and gene-level effects across a number of operational definitions of depression (e.g., lifetime diagnosis, current severity, episode recurrence) and environmental moderators (e.g., sexual or physical abuse during childhood, socioeconomic adversity). Results: No clear evidence was found for any candidate gene polymorphism associations with depression phenotypes or any polymorphism-by-environment moderator effects. As a set, depression candidate genes were no more associated with depression phenotypes than noncandidate genes. The authors demonstrate that phenotypic measurement error is unlikely to account for these null findings. Conclusions: The study results do not support previous depression candidate gene findings, in which large genetic effects are frequently reported in samples orders of magnitude smaller than those examined here. Instead, the results suggest that early hypotheses about depression candidate genes were incorrect and that the large number of associations reported in the depression candidate gene literature are likely to be false positives.},

  abstract = {The goal was to examine the association between urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphate metabolites of organophosphates and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children 8 to 15 years of age.Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2000–2004) were available for 1139 children, who were representative of the general US population. A structured interview with a parent was used to ascertain ADHD diagnostic status, on the basis of slightly modified criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.One hundred nineteen children met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Children with higher urinary dialkyl phosphate concentrations, especially dimethyl alkylphosphate (DMAP) concentrations, were more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD. A 10-fold increase in DMAP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of 1.55 (95\% confidence interval: 1.14–2.10), with adjustment for gender, age, race/ethnicity, poverty/income ratio, fasting duration, and urinary creatinine concentration. For the most-commonly detected DMAP metabolite, dimethyl thiophosphate, children with levels higher than the median of detectable concentrations had twice the odds of ADHD (adjusted odds ratio: 1.93 [95\% confidence interval: 1.23–3.02]), compared with children with undetectable levels.These findings support the hypothesis that organophosphate exposure, at levels common among US children, may contribute to ADHD prevalence. Prospective studies are needed to establish whether this association is causal.},

  abstract = {Early life exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may alter adipogenesis and energy balance leading to changes in obesity risk. Several studies have evaluated the association of prenatal bisphenol A exposure with childhood body size but only one study of male infants has examined other environmental phenols. Therefore, we assessed associations between prenatal exposure to environmental phenols and fat mass in a prospective birth cohort. We quantified four phenol biomarkers in third trimester maternal spot urine samples in a cohort of women enrolled in New York City between 1998 and 2002 and evaluated fat mass in their children using a Tanita scale between ages 4 and 9years (173 children with 351 total observations). We estimated associations of standard deviation differences in natural log creatinine-standardized phenol biomarker concentrations with percent fat mass using linear mixed effects regression models. We did not observe associations of bisphenol A or triclosan with childhood percent fat mass. In unadjusted models, maternal urinary concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol were associated with greater percent fat mass and benzophenone-3 was associated with lower percent fat mass among children. After adjustment, phenol biomarkers were not associated with percent fat mass. However, the association between benzophenone-3 and percent fat mass was modified by child's sex: benzophenone-3 concentrations were inversely associated with percent fat mass in girls (beta=−1.51, 95\% CI=−3.06, 0.01) but not boys (beta=−0.20, 95\% CI=−1.69, 1.26). Although we did not observe strong evidence that prenatal environmental phenols exposures influence the development of childhood adiposity, the potential antiadipogenic effect of benzophenone-3 in girls may warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {Background: Several studies suggest that exposure to organophosphate insecticides (OP) during pregnancy impairs neurodevelopment in children. Objectives: We evaluated associations between biomarkers of prenatal and postnatal OP exposure and cognitive function of 6-year-olds in a French longitudinal birth cohort. Methods: In 2002–2006, the PELAGIE mother–child cohort enrolled pregnant women from Brittany. For a random subcohort, we measured nonspecific dialkylphosphate metabolites (DAP) of OP in one maternal urine sample, collected before 19 weeks’ gestation, and in one urine sample collected from their 6-year-old children. Six subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition (WISC-IV) were administered when the children were 6 years of age to evaluate cognitive function (n = 231). Linear regression models controlling for factors including maternal intelligence and the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment score were used. Results: WISC-IV scores were not significantly associated with prenatal or childhood total DAP metabolites. WISC verbal comprehension score was significantly higher in association with the highest maternal urinary concentrations of diethylphosphate (DE) metabolites (5.5; 95\% CI: 0.8, 10.3 for {$>$} 13.2 nmol/L vs. {$<$} LOQ), whereas WISC working memory score was significantly lower in association with the highest urinary concentrations of DE metabolites at age 6 years (–3.6; 95\% CI: –7.8, –0.6 for {$>$} 11.1 nmol/L vs. {$<$} LOD). Conclusion: We found no evidence that prenatal OP exposure adversely affected cognitive function in 6-year-olds, perhaps because of the population’s socioeconomic status, which was higher than in previous studies, though other causal and noncausal explanations are also possible. The negative association between WISC score and concurrent DE urinary concentrations requires replication by longitudinal studies investigating childhood OP exposure.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposome studies are challenged by exposure misclassification for non-persistent chemicals, whose temporal variability contributes to bias in dose-response functions. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the variability of urinary concentrations of 24 non-persistent chemicals: 10 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols, 6 organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites, and cotinine, between weeks from different pregnancy trimesters in pregnant women, and between days and between seasons in children. METHODS: 154 pregnant women and 152 children from six European countries were enrolled in 2014-2015. Pregnant women provided three urine samples over a day (morning, midday, and night), for one week in the 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters. Children provided two urines a day (morning and night), over two one-week periods, six months apart. We pooled all samples for a given subject that were collected within a week. In children, we also made four daily pools (combining morning and night voids) during the last four days of the first follow-up week. Pools were analyzed for all 24 metabolites of interest. We calculated intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and estimated the number of pools needed to obtain an ICC above 0.80. RESULTS: All phthalate metabolites and phenols were detected in {$>$}90\% of pools whereas certain OP pesticide metabolites and cotinine were detected in {$<$}43\% of pools. We observed fair (ICC = 0.40-0.59) to good (0.60-0.74) between-day reliability of the pools of two samples in children for all chemicals. Reliability was poor ({$<$}0.40) to fair between trimesters in pregnant women and between seasons in children. For most chemicals, three daily pools of two urines each (for weekly exposure windows) and four weekly pools of 15-20 urines each would be necessary to obtain an ICC above 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: This quantification of the variability of biomarker measurements of many non-persistent chemicals during several time windows shows that for many of these compounds a few dozen samples are required to accurately assess exposure over periods encompassing several trimesters or months.},

  abstract = {Introduction Brain development is highly dependent on hormonal regulation. Exposure to chemicals disrupting endocrine signaling has been associated with neurodevelopmental impairment. This raises concern about exposure to the suspected thousands of endocrine disruptors, and has resulted in efforts to improve regulation of these chemicals. Yet, the causal links between endocrine disruption and developmental neurotoxicity, which would be required for regulatory action, are still largely missing.Areas covered In this review, we illustrate the importance of two endocrine systems, thyroid hormone and retinoic acid pathways, for neurodevelopment. We place special emphasis on TH and RA synthesis, metabolism, and how endocrine disrupting chemicals known or suspected to affect these systems are associated with developmental neurotoxicity.Expert opinion While it is clear that neurodevelopment is dependent on proper hormonal functioning, and evidence is increasing for developmental neurotoxicity induced by endocrine disrupting chemicals, this is not grasped by current chemical testing. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop test methods detecting endocrine disruption in the context of neurodevelopment. Key to this development is further mechanistic insights on the involvement of endocrine signaling in neurodevelopment as well as increased support to develop and validate new test methods for the regulatory context.},

Associations between g and specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several candidate genes involved in brain function have been reported. We sought to replicate published associations between g and 12 specific genetic variants (in the genes DTNBP1, CTSD, DRD2, ANKK1, CHRM2, SSADH, COMT, BDNF, CHRNA4, DISC1, APOE, and SNAP25) using data sets from three independent, well-characterized longitudinal studies with samples of 5,571, 1,759, and 2,441 individuals. Of 32 independent tests across all three data sets, only 1 was nominally significant. By contrast, power analyses showed that we should have expected 10 to 15 significant associations, given reasonable assumptions for genotype effect sizes. For positive controls, we confirmed accepted genetic associations for Alzheimer?s disease and body mass index, and we used SNP-based calculations of genetic relatedness to replicate previous estimates that about half of the variance in g is accounted for by common genetic variation among individuals. We conclude that the molecular genetics of psychology and social science requires approaches that go beyond the examination of candidate genes.},

Increasing concentrations have been reported in human populations over the past decade. Recent studies have linked prenatal OPE exposure to hyperactivity and attention problems in children. Such behaviors are often found among children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however, no study has investigated OPEs in relation to clinically assessed ADHD. Objective To evaluate prenatal exposure to OPEs as risk factors for clinically assessed ADHD using a case-cohort study nested within the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Methods We included in the case group 295 ADHD cases obtained via linkage with the Norwegian Patient Registry, and the sub-cohort group 555 children sampled at baseline, irrespective of their ADHD case status. Prenatal concentrations of OPE metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at 17~weeks of gestation, and included diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP), bis(2-butoxyethyl) hydrogen phosphate (BBOEP), and bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP). We estimated risk ratios and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals [95\% CI] using logistic regression, adjusting for season of urine collection, child sex, birth year, and maternal depression, education, and sum of urinary di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) concentration during pregnancy. To assess the overall impact of simultaneously decreasing exposure to all chemical constituents of an OPE-phthalate mixture, quantile based g-computation was implemented. The mixture constituents included OPE and phthalate metabolites commonly detected in our study. In all models, we considered effect measure modification by child sex and polymorphisms in genes encoding paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. Mediation analysis was conducted using thyroid function biomarkers estimated from maternal blood collected at 17~weeks of gestation. Results DPHP was detected in nearly all samples (97.2\%), with a higher geometric mean among the case group (0.70~µg/L) as compared to the sub-cohort (0.52~µg/L). DNBP was commonly detected as well (93.8\%), while BBOEP (52.9\%) and BDCIPP (22.9\%) were detected less frequently. A higher risk of ADHD was observed in children with greater than median exposure to DPHP during pregnancy (risk ratio: 1.38 [95\% CI: 0.96, 1.99]), which was slightly higher among girls (2.04 [1.03, 4.02]) and children of mothers with PON1 Q192R genotype QR (1.69 [0.89, 3.19]) or PON1 Q192R genotype RR (4.59 [1.38, 15.29]). The relationship between DPHP and ADHD (total risk ratio: 1.34 [0.90, 2.02]) was partially mediated through total triiodothyronine to total thyroxine ratio (natural direct effect: 1.29 [0.87, 1.94]; natural indirect effect: 1.04 [1.00, 1.10]; 12.48\% mediated). We also observed an elevated risk of ADHD in relation to BDCIPP detection during pregnancy (1.50 [0.98, 2.28]). We did not observe notable differences in ADHD by DNBP (0.88 [0.62, 1.26]) or BBOEP (1.03 [0.73, 1.46]) during pregnancy. Simultaneously decreasing all constituents of common-detect OPE-phthalate mixture, specifically DPHP, DNBP, and 6 phthalate metabolites, by a quartile resulted in an ADHD risk ratio of 0.68 [0.64, 0.72]. Conclusion Prenatal exposure to DPHP and BDCIPP may increase the risk of ADHD. For DPHP, we observed potential modification by child sex and maternal PON1 Q192R genotype and partial mediation through maternal thyroid hormone imbalance at 17~weeks gestation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Metabolic differences have been reported between individuals with and without Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), but their consistency and causal relevance has been unclear. METHODS: We conducted a metabolome-wide association study of MDD with 249 metabolomic measures available in UK Biobank (N = 29, 757). We then applied 2-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomisation (MR) and colocalization analysis to identify potentially causal relationships between each metabolite and MDD. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one metabolites tested were significantly associated with MDD (PFDR {$<$} 0.05), which reduced to 129 after adjustment for likely confounders. Lower abundance of Omega-3 fatty acid measures and a higher Omega-6: Omega-3 ratio showed potentially causal effects on liability to MDD. There was no evidence of a causal effect of MDD on metabolite levels. Furthermore, genetic signals associated with Docosahexaenoic Acid colocalized with loci associated with MDD within the FADS gene cluster. Post-hoc MR of gene-transcript abundance within the FADS cluster demonstrated a causal association with MDD. In contrast, colocalization analysis did not suggest a single causal variant for both transcript abundance and MDD liability, but the likely existence of two variants in LD with one another. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that decreased Docosahexaenoic Acid and increased Omega-6: Omega-3 fatty acids ratio may be causally related to MDD. These findings provide further support for the causal involvement of fatty acids in MDD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Higher urate levels are associated with higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) in adults, and in pregnancy with lower offspring birthweight. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses suggest a causal effect of higher urate on higher SBP and of higher maternal SBP on lower offspring birthweight. If urate causally reduces birthweight, it might confound the effect of SBP on birthweight. We therefore tested for a causal effect of maternal urate on offspring birthweight. METHODS: We tested the association between maternal urate levels and offspring birthweight using multivariable linear regression in the Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH; n\,=\,872) and UK Biobank (UKB; n\,=\,133{$\mkern1mu$}187). We conducted two-sample MR to test for a causal effect of maternal urate [114 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); n\,=\,288{$\mkern1mu$}649 European ancestry] on offspring birthweight (n\,=\,406{$\mkern1mu$}063 European ancestry; maternal SNP effect estimates adjusted for fetal effects). We assessed a causal relationship between urate and SBP using one-sample MR in UKB women (n\,=\,199{$\mkern1mu$}768). RESULTS: Higher maternal urate was associated with lower offspring birthweight with similar confounder-adjusted magnitudes in EFSOCH [22\,g lower birthweight per 1-SD higher urate (95\%~CI: -50, 6); P\,=\,0.13] and UKB [-28\,g (95\% CI: -31, -25); P\,=\,1.8\,×\,10-75]. The MR causal effect estimate was directionally consistent, but smaller [-11\,g (95\%~CI: -25, 3); PIVW\,=\,0.11]. In women, higher urate was causally associated with higher SBP [1.7\,mmHg higher SBP per 1-SD higher urate (95\%~CI: 1.4, 2.1); P\,=\,7.8\,×\,10-22], consistent with that previously published in women and men. CONCLUSION: The marked attenuation of the MR result of maternal urate on offspring birthweight compared with the multivariable regression result suggests previous observational associations may be confounded. The 95\% CIs of the MR result included the null but suggest a possible small effect on birthweight. Maternal urate levels are unlikely to be an important contributor to offspring birthweight.},

Leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR can be used to estimate the causal effects of one phenotype on another even when experimental research is not feasible, and therefore has the potential to be highly informative. It is dependent on strong assumptions however, often producing biased results if these are not met. It is therefore imperative that these assumptions are well-understood by researchers aiming to use MR, in order to evaluate their validity in the context of their analyses and data. The aim of this perspective is therefore to further elucidate these assumptions and the role they play in MR, as well as how different kinds of data can be used to further support them.},

  abstract = {Some environmental contaminants interact with hormones and may exert adverse consequences as a result of their actions as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Exposure in people is typically a result of contamination of the food chain, inhalation of contaminated house dust or occupational exposure. EDCs include pesticides and herbicides (such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane or its metabolites), methoxychlor, biocides, heat stabilisers and chemical catalysts (such as tributyltin), plastic contaminants (e.g. bisphenol A), pharmaceuticals (i.e. diethylstilbestrol; 17α-ethinylestradiol) or dietary components (such as phytoestrogens). The goal of this review is to address the sources, effects and actions of EDCs, with an emphasis on topics discussed at the International Congress on Steroids and the Nervous System. EDCs may alter reproductively-relevant or nonreproductive, sexually-dimorphic behaviours. In addition, EDCs may have significant effects on neurodevelopmental processes, influencing the morphology of sexually-dimorphic cerebral circuits. Exposure to EDCs is more dangerous if it occurs during specific ‘critical periods’ of life, such as intrauterine, perinatal, juvenile or puberty periods, when organisms are more sensitive to hormonal disruption, compared to other periods. However, exposure to EDCs in adulthood can also alter physiology. Several EDCs are xenoestrogens, which can alter serum lipid concentrations or metabolism enzymes that are necessary for converting cholesterol to steroid hormones. This can ultimately alter the production of oestradiol and/or other steroids. Finally, many EDCs may have actions via (or independent of) classic actions at cognate steroid receptors. EDCs may have effects through numerous other substrates, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and the retinoid X receptor, signal transduction pathways, calcium influx and/or neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, EDCs, from varied sources, may have organisational effects during development and/or activational effects in adulthood that influence sexually-dimorphic, reproductively-relevant processes or other functions, by mimicking, antagonising or altering steroidal actions.},

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) has been associated with different neurodevelopmental outcomes across different cohorts. A phenotypic approach may address some of these differences by incorporating information across scales and accounting for the complex correlational structure of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, Bayesian hierarchical modeling can account for confounding by collinear co-exposures. We use this framework to examine associations between prenatal exposure to OPs and behavior, executive functioning, and IQ assessed at age 6–9 years in a cohort of 404 mother/infant pairs recruited during pregnancy. We derived phenotypes of neurodevelopment with a factor analysis, and estimated associations between OP metabolites and these phenotypes in Bayesian hierarchical models for exposure mixtures. We report seven factors: 1) Impulsivity and Externalizing, 2) Executive Functioning, 3) Internalizing, 4) Perceptual Reasoning, 5) Adaptability, 6) Processing Speed, and 7) Verbal Intelligence. These, along with the Working Memory Index, were standardized and scaled so that positive values reflected positive attributes and negative values represented adverse outcomes. Standardized dimethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with Internalizing factor scores (β\^ − 0.13, 95\% CI − 0.26, 0.00) but positively associated with Executive Functioning factor scores (β\^ 0.18, 95\% CI 0.04, 0.31). Standardized diethylphosphate metabolites were negatively associated with the Working Memory Index (β\^ − 0.17, 95\% CI − 0.33, − 0.03). Associations with factor scores were generally stronger and more precise than associations with individual instrument-specific items. Factor analysis of outcomes may provide some advantages in etiological studies of childhood neurodevelopment by incorporating information across scales to reduce dimensionality and improve precision.},

We assessed cognitive and psychomotor development of their children at 1 and 4 years, and social competence, ADHD symptoms and other behavioral problems at 4 and 7 years. No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (β=−1.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI)=−2.78, −0.21]). Σ4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.},

  abstract = {The simultaneous determination of a large number of steroids (a.k.a. steroid profile) is a powerful tool that provides useful information about the status of steroid hormones. Steroid profile evaluated in matrices such as urine, saliva and plasma provide one-off moment information about the hormonal status and is highly affected by different factors such as circadian rhythm or apprehension to needles. In contrast, the determination of the steroid profile in hair would provide information about the chronic status of the steroid hormones. The objective of the current research was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methodology for the determination of 11 steroids in hair, including 6 hormones and 5 metabolites. We have optimized different parts of the analytical procedure such as (i) hair shredding, (ii) hair amount, (iii) extraction from hair, (iv) extraction time, (v) required extractions and (vi) analytes preconcentration. MS parameters such as the inclusion of ESI- transitions were also evaluated. The optimization of these parameters was found to be critical to achieve the required sensitivity for the determination of steroids in hair. The method was validated with appropriate linearity in the endogenous range, intra- and inter-assay accuracies and matrix effect between 80\% and 120\% and intra- and inter-assay precisions below 20\% for all analytes. Most of the analytes showed to be stable up to 10 months at room temperature. The suitability of the method was evaluated by obtaining the endogenous concentration range of steroids in 30 healthy volunteers. Results agreed with the scarce data previously reported for some steroids. For others, endogenous concentration ranges in hair were reported for the first time. Additionally, the method was used to compare intraindividual levels of steroids in beard and hair. Results revealed that with the exception of testosterone, beard is a suitable alternative to the hair determination of the steroid profile. In summary, the present strategy to evaluate the steroid profile in hair may be a useful tool with a high potential for a wide range of clinical purposes.},

  abstract = {Background Childrens exposure to neurotoxic compounds poses a major problem to public health because of their actively developing brain that makes them highly vulnerable. However, limited information is available on neuropsychological effects in children associated with pre- and postnatal exposures to pesticides. Objective To evaluate the association between current and pre- and postnatal exposures to pesticides and their effects on neurodevelopment in children aged 6–11years living in agricultural communities from South-Eastern Spain. Methods An ambispective study was conducted on 305 children aged 6–11years randomly selected from public schools of the study area. Current exposure to organophosphate pesticides was assessed measuring children's urinary levels of dialkylphosphates (DAPs). Both prenatal and postnatal residential exposure to pesticides was estimated by developing a geographical information system (GIS) technology-based index that integrated distance-weighted measure of agricultural surface, time-series of crop areas per municipality and year, and land-use maps. Neuropsychological performance was evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV). The association of pre- and postnatal and current pesticide exposure with WISC-IV scale scores was assessed using multivariate linear regression models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, respectively. Results Greater urinary DAP levels were associated with a poorer performance on intelligence quotient and verbal comprehension domain, with effects being more prominent in boys than in girls. The influence of an increase in 10ha per year in crop surface around the child's residence during the postnatal period was associated with decreased intelligence quotient, processing speed and verbal comprehension scores. As regards prenatal exposure to pesticides, a poor processing speed performance was observed. These effects were also more prominent in boys than in girls. Conclusions Our results suggest that postnatal exposure to pesticides can negatively affect children's neuropsychological performance. Prenatal exposure was weakly associated to neurodevelopment impairment.},

Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants-manganese, fluoride, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity. To coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention, we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse.},

Without consideration of genotype, light-smoking (mean 4.8 cigarettes/day) during pregnancy was associated with a small increase in LBW risk, adjusted OR 1.21; 95\% CI 0.44 – 3.31. The corresponding odds for IUGR risk was 1.57; 95\% CI 0.45 – 5.55. The findings suggested the greater LBW risk among light-smoking mothers with the GSTM1-null genotype (OR 1.91; 95\% CI 0.43 – 8.47) compared to those with GSTM1-present genotype (OR 1.11; 95\% CI 0.26 – 4.47). When both GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes were considered, the synergistic effect was found among smoking mothers: GSTT1-present and GSTM1-null genotype OR for LBW was 3.31; 95\% CI 0.60-18.4 and that for IUGR was 2.47; 95\% CI 0.31 – 13.1. However there was no statistically significant interaction between maternal smoking, GSTT1- present and GSTM1-null genotypes for LBW (OR 1.45; 95\% CI 0.22 – 10.1, p = 0.66) and for IUGR (OR 1.10; 95\% CI 0.10 – 12.6, p = 0.93).The results of this study suggested that smoking, even at a low-level, ought to be considered a potential risk factor for adverse birth outcomes and that genetic polymorphism may contribute to individual variation in tobacco smoke response.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies have indicated that maternal prenatal substance use may be associated with offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) via intrauterine effects. We measured associations between prenatal smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption with childhood ADHD symptoms accounting for shared familial factors. DESIGN: First, we used a negative control design comparing maternal and paternal substance use. Three models were used for negative control analyses: unadjusted (without confounders), adjusted (including confounders) and mutually adjusted (including confounders and partner's substance use). The results were meta-analysed across the cohorts. Secondly, we used polygenic risk scores (PRS) as proxies for exposures. Maternal PRS for smoking, alcohol and coffee consumption were regressed against ADHD symptoms. We triangulated the results across the two approaches to infer causality. SETTING: We used data from three longitudinal pregnancy cohorts: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the United Kingdom, Generation R study (GenR) in the Netherlands and Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study (MoBa) in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Phenotype data available for children were: NALSPAC \,=\,5455-7751; NGENR \,=\,1537-3119; NMOBA \,=\,28\,053-42\,206. Genotype data available for mothers was: NALSPAC \,=\,7074; NMOBA \,=\,14\,583. MEASUREMENTS: A measure of offspring ADHD symptoms at age 7-8~years was derived by dichotomizing scores from questionnaires and parental self-reported prenatal substance use was measured at the second pregnancy trimester. FINDINGS: The pooled estimate for maternal prenatal substance use showed an association with total ADHD symptoms [odds ratio (OR)SMOKING \,=\,1.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,1.00-1.23; ORALCOHOL \,=\,1.27, 95\% CI\,=\,1.08-1.49; ORCAFFEINE \,=\,1.05, 95\% CI\,=\,1.00-1.11], while not for fathers (ORSMOKING \,=\,1.03, 95\% CI\,=\,0.95-1.13; ORALCOHOL \,=\,0.83, 95\% CI\,=\,0.47-1.48; ORCAFFEINE \,=\,1.02, 95\% CI\,=\,0.97-1.07). However, maternal associations did not persist in sensitivity analyses (substance use before pregnancy, adjustment for maternal ADHD symptoms in MoBa). The PRS analyses were inconclusive for an association in ALSPAC or MoBa. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no causal intrauterine effect of maternal prenatal substance use on offspring attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.},

  abstract = {Background Harmonized data describing simultaneous exposure to a large number of environmental contaminants in-utero and during childhood is currently very limited. Objectives To characterize concentrations of a large number of environmental contaminants in pregnant women from Europe and their children, based on chemical analysis of biological samples from mother-child pairs. Methods We relied on the Early-Life Exposome project, HELIX, a collaborative project across six established population-based birth cohort studies in Europe. In 1301 subjects, biomarkers of exposure to 45 contaminants (i.e. organochlorine compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, toxic and essential elements, phthalate metabolites, environmental phenols, organophosphate pesticide metabolites and cotinine) were measured in biological samples from children (6–12\,years) and their mothers during pregnancy, using highly sensitive biomonitoring methods. Results Most of the exposure biomarkers had high detection frequencies in mothers (35 out of 45 biomarkers with {$>$}90\% detected) and children (33 out of 45 biomarkers with {$>$}90\% detected). Concentrations were significantly different between cohorts for all compounds, and were generally higher in maternal compared to children samples. For most of the persistent compounds the correlations between maternal and child concentrations were moderate to high (Spearman Rho\,{$>$}\,0.35), while for most non-persistent compounds correlations were considerably lower (Spearman Rho\,{$<$}\,0.15). For mercury, PFOS and PFOA a considerable proportion of the samples of both mothers and their children exceeded the HBM I value established by The Human Biomonitoring Commission of the German Federal Environment Agency. Discussion Although not based on a representative sample, our study suggests that children across Europe are exposed to a wide range of environmental contaminants in fetal life and childhood including many with potential adverse effects. For values exceeding the HBM I value identification of specific sources of exposure and reducing exposure in an adequate way is recommended. Considerable variability in this “chemical exposome” was seen between cohorts, showing that place of residence is a strong determinant of one's personal exposome. This extensive dataset comprising {$>$}100,000 concentrations of environmental contaminants in mother-child pairs forms a unique possibility for conducting epidemiological studies using an exposome approach.},

  abstract = {Development of the mammalian central nervous system is a complex process whose disruption may have severe and long-lasting consequences upon brain structure and function, potentially resulting in a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Many NDDs are known to be genetic in origin, with symptom onset and their underlying mechanisms now known to be regulated during time-dependent windows or 'critical periods' during normal brain development. However, it is increasingly evident that similar disturbances to the developing nervous system may be caused by exposure to non-genetic, environmental factors. Strikingly, at least 200 industrially applied or produced chemicals have been associated with neurotoxicity in humans and exposure to these modifying compounds, through consumer products or environmental pollution, therefore poses serious threats to public health. Through a combination of human epidemiological and animal experimental studies, we identified developmental periods for increased vulnerability to environmentally-modifying compounds and determined whether and how exposure during specific sensitive time-windows could increase the risk for the NDDs of autism, ADHD or schizophrenia in the developing organism. We report that many environmental toxicants have distinct sensitive time-windows during which exposure may disrupt critical developmental events, thereby increasing the risk of developing NDDs. The majority of these time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. We propose four underlying mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis, namely oxidative stress, immune system dysregulation, altered neurotransmission and thyroid hormone disruption. Given the complexity of underlying mechanisms and their prenatal inception, treatment options are currently limited. Thus, we conclude that preventing early exposure to environmental toxicants, by increasing public awareness and improving government and industry guidelines, may ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of NDDs.},

  abstract = {Few studies have examined the association between environmental phthalate exposure and children’s neurocognitive development. This longitudinal study examined cognitive function in relation to pre-and postnatal phthalate exposure in children 2–12 years old. We recruited 430 pregnant women in their third trimester in Taichung, Taiwan from 2001–2002. A total of 110, 79, 76, and 73 children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively. We evaluated the children’s cognitive function at four different time points using the Bayley and Wechsler tests for assessing neurocognitive functions and intelligence (IQ). Urine samples were collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at each follow-up visit. They were analyzed for seven metabolite concentrations of widely used phthalate esters. These esters included monomethyl phthalate, monoethyl phthalate, mono-butyl phthalate, mono-benzyl phthalate, and three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, namely, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate. We constructed a linear mixed model to examine the relationships between the phthalate metabolite concentrations and the Bayley and IQ scores. We found significant inverse associations between the children’s levels of urinary mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate and the sum of the three metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and their IQ scores (β = -1.818; 95\% CI: -3.061, -0.574, p = 0.004 for mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate; β = -1.575; 95\% CI: -3.037, -0.113, p = 0.035 for the sum of the three metabolites) after controlling for maternal phthalate levels and potential confounders. We did not observe significant associations between maternal phthalate exposure and the children’s IQ scores. Children’s but not prenatal phthalate exposure was associated with decreased cognitive development in the young children. Large-scale prospective cohort studies are needed to confirm these findings in the future.},

  abstract = {Introduction Phthalate exposure may reduce intellectual development in young children. In 2011, numerous Taiwanese children had been reported to have consumed phthalate-tainted products. We investigated the effects of phthalate exposure on the intellectual development of these children after the 2011 Taiwan di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) episode. Methods We recruited 204 children, aged 3–12 y, from 3 hospitals in Taiwan between 2012 and 2013. First-morning urine samples were collected for analyzing 5 phthalate metabolites. We applied a Bayesian model to estimate the past DEHP exposure (estDEHPADD) of each participant before the 2011 DEHP episode. Demographic information, consumption of phthalate-tainted products, and maternal education, of each participant were obtained using a questionnaire. We used the Wechsler intelligence evaluation tools for assessing the children's and maternal intelligence quotient. Results and discussion The median levels of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-n-butyl phthalate, and mono-iso-butyl phthalate in the children were 9.97, 45.8, 32.2, 46.2, and 24.3μg/g creatinine, respectively. Using the aforementioned urinary phthalate metabolites, we found that the children's verbal comprehension index (N =98) was significantly negatively associated with urinary log10 MEOHP (β, −11.92; SE, 5.33; 95\%CI, −22.52\textasciitilde{} −1.33; P=0.028) and log10 ΣDBP metabolites (β, −10.95; SE, 4.93; 95\%CI, −20.74\textasciitilde{} −1.16; P=0.029) after adjustment for age, gender, maternal IQ and education, passive smoking, estDEHPADD, active and passive smoking during pregnancy. Through a tolerable daily intake-based approach, we only found a significant negative association between past estimate DEHPADD and VIQ≥3-{$<$}6 in preschool children whereas no correlation was observed between current DEHP exposure and IQ≥3-{$<$}6 score with/ without estimate DEHPADD adjustment. It revealed that the effect of past high-DEHP exposure on verbal-related neurodevelopment of younger child are more sensitive. Conclusion Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to DEHP and DnBP affects intellectual development in preschool and school-aged children, particularly their language learning or expression ability.},

  abstract = {Studying causal effects of continuous treatments is important for gaining a deeper understanding of many interventions, policies, or medications, yet researchers are often left with observational studies for doing so. In the observational setting, confounding is a barrier to the estimation of causal effects. Weighting approaches seek to control for confounding by reweighting samples so that confounders are comparable across different treatment values. Yet, for continuous treatments, weighting methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification. In this article we elucidate the key property that makes weights effective in estimating causal quantities involving continuous treatments. We show that to eliminate confounding, weights should make treatment and confounders independent on the weighted scale. We develop a measure that characterizes the degree to which a set of weights induces such independence. Further, we propose a new model-free method for weight estimation by optimizing our measure. We study the theoretical properties of our measure and our weights, and prove that our weights can explicitly mitigate treatment-confounder dependence. The empirical effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a suite of challenging numerical experiments, where we find that our weights are quite robust and work well under a broad range of settings. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We also investigated the differential effects of phthalate exposure on the intelligence and attention according to exposure period (maternal or children). Urine concentrations of mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) were analyzed. Multivariable linear regression models were used to investigate the relationship between exposure to various phthalates with IQ scores and continuous performance test (CPT) variables. There were robust associations between child MEHHP and MEOHP levels with full scale IQ (FSIQ) even after adjusting for demographic variables and CPT scores (MEHHP −9.27, 95\% CI: −17.25, −1.29; MEOHP −9.83, 95\% CI: −17.44, −2.21). Child MEHHP and MEHOP levels negatively affected omission errors (MEHHP −20.36, 95\% CI: −34.17, −6.55; MEOHP −18.93, 95\% CI: −32.58, −5.28) and the response time variability (MEHHP −21.07, 95\% CI: −39.04, −3.10; MEOHP −20.41, 95\% CI −38.14, −2.69) of the CPT after adjusting for demographic variables and IQ. Maternal phthalate exposure had no effects on IQ or CPT variables. These results suggest that children phthalate exposure, but not maternal exposure, has an adverse effect on IQ and attentional performance, and these associations were found to be independent of each other.},

  abstract = {Several studies suggested potential links of phthalates to stress-related outcomes. However, limited evidence has been available for the relationships between phthalate metabolites and free cortisol and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in perinatal and postnatal environments. Therefore, we evaluated the relationships between phthalate metabolites and free cortisol and 8-OHdG in mother–child pairs. We repeatedly collected urine samples of 287 mother–child pairs from just before delivery to 15\,months of age to measure the levels of four phthalate metabolites – mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) – and free cortisol and 8-OHdG. We used linear mixed effect models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate the relationship between the phthalate metabolites and free cortisol and 8-OHdG after adjusting for the child's gender, urine collection time, and maternal smoking status. The four phthalate metabolite levels were strongly correlated each other (all, p\,{$<$}\,.0001), and intra-class correlation for each metabolite in children ranged from 0.18 to 0.96. All four phthalate metabolites were positively associated with both free cortisol (MEHHP, β\,=\,0.18 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; MEOHP, β\,=\,0.17 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; MiBP, β\,=\,0.13 and p\,=\,.0001; MnBP, β\,=\,0.21 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; and molar sum of metabolites, β\,=\,0.21 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001) and 8-OHdG (MEHHP, β\,=\,0.20 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; MEOHP, β\,=\,0.18 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; MiBP, β\,=\,0.23 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; MnBP, β\,=\,0.28 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001; and molar sum of metabolites, β\,=\,0.29 and p\,{$<$}\,.0001) in childhood.

  abstract = {The package VIM (Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) is developed to explore and analyze the structure of missing values in data using visualization methods, to impute these missing values with the built-in imputation methods and to verify the imputation process using visualization tools, as well as to produce high-quality graphics for publications. This article focuses on the different imputation techniques available in the package. Four different imputation methods are currently implemented in VIM, namely hot-deck imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, regression imputation and iterative robust model-based imputation (Templ, Kowarik, and Filzmoser 2011). All of these methods are implemented in a flexible manner with many options for customization. Furthermore in this article practical examples are provided to highlight the use of the implemented methods on real-world applications. In addition, the graphical user interface of VIM has been re-implemented from scratch resulting in the package VIMGUI (Schopfhauser, Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) to enable users without extensive R skills to access these imputation and visualization methods.},

  abstract = {Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease (AD), the two most common neurodegenerative disorders in American adults, are of purely genetic origin in a minority of cases and appear in most instances to arise through interactions among genetic and environmental factors. In this article we hypothesize that environmental exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance and review evidence for the early environmental origins of neurodegeneration. For PD the first recognized environmental cause, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), was identified in epidemiologic studies of drug abusers. Chemicals experimentally linked to PD include the insecticide rotenone and the herbicides paraquat and maneb; interaction has been observed between paraquat and maneb. In epidemiologic studies, manganese has been linked to parkinsonism. In dementia, lead is associated with increased risk in chronically exposed workers. Exposures of children in early life to lead, polychlorinated biphenyls, and methylmercury have been followed by persistent decrements in intelligence that may presage dementia. To discover new environmental causes of AD and PD, and to characterize relevant gene–environment interactions, we recommend that a large, prospective genetic and epidemiologic study be undertaken that will follow thousands of children from conception (or before) to old age. Additional approaches to etiologic discovery include establishing incidence registries for AD and PD, conducting targeted investigations in high-risk populations, and improving testing of the potential neurologic toxicity of chemicals.},

In this study, we have examined the early life determinants of childhood intelligence in a population-based birth cohort of individuals born in Brisbane, Australia between 1981 and 1984. In univariable analyses, family income in the year of birth, maternal and paternal education, maternal age at birth, maternal ethnicity, maternal smoking during pregnancy, duration of labour, birthweight, breast feeding and childhood height, and body mass index were all associated with intelligence at age 14. In multivariable analyses, the strongest and most robust predictors of intelligence were family income, parental education and breast feeding, with these three variables explaining 7.5\% of the variation in intelligence at age 14. Addition of other variables added little further explanatory power. Our results demonstrate the importance of indicators of socio-economic position as predictors of intelligence, and illustrate the need to consider the role of such factors in generating the association of childhood intelligence with adult disease risk.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Studies have shown that the exposure to BPA is associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) during adolescent development. However the direct clinical evidence is limited. To investigate the possible association between environmental BPA exposure and the altered behavior of children, a case-control study was conducted with children aged 6–12 years in Guangzhou, China. Two hundred fifteen children diagnosed with ADHD and 253 healthy children from Guangzhou were recruited as the case and control groups, respectively. Urinary BPA and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage) concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem spectrometry. The results showed that concentrations of urinary BPA for the case group were significantly higher than those for the control group (3.44 vs 1.70\,μg/L; 4.63 vs 1.71\,μg/g Crt. p\,{$<$}\,.001). A stepwise increase in the odds ratios for ADHD was observed with the increasing quartiles of children's urinary BPA (first quartile: reference category; second quartile adjusted OR: 1.79, 95\% CI: 0.95–3.37; third quartile adjusted OR: 7.44, 95\% CI: 3.91–14.1; fourth quartile adjusted OR: 9.41, 95\% CI: 4.91–18.1). When the BPA levels were stratified by gender, the odds of ADHD among boys and girls increased significantly with urinary BPA concentrations (adjusted OR: 4.58, 95\% CI: 2.84–7.37; adjusted OR: 2.83, 95\% CI: 1.17–6.84). Urinary 8-OHdG concentrations in the ADHD children were significantly higher than those in the control group. Furthermore, the linear regression analysis results indicated that a significant relationship existed between BPA exposure and 8-OHdG levels (R\,=\,0.257, p\,{$<$}\,.001). Our findings provide direct evidence that childhood BPA exposure may be related to ADHD and 8-OHdG concentrations for children. Moreover, BPA exposure could increase the higher occurrence of ADHD for boy than for girls.},

  abstract = {Purpose Essential to exposome research is the collection of data on many environmental exposures from different domains in the same subjects. The aim of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) study was to measure and describe multiple environmental exposures during early life (pregnancy and childhood) in a prospective cohort and associate these exposures with molecular omics signatures and child health outcomes. Here, we describe recruitment, measurements available and baseline data of the HELIX study populations. Participants The HELIX study represents a collaborative project across six established and ongoing longitudinal population-based birth cohort studies in six European countries (France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain and the UK). HELIX used a multilevel study design with the entire study population totalling 31 472 mother-child pairs, recruited during pregnancy, in the six existing cohorts (first level); a subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs where biomarkers, omics signatures and child health outcomes were measured at age 6–11 years (second level) and repeat-sampling panel studies with around 150 children and 150 pregnant women aimed at collecting personal exposure data (third level). Findings to date Cohort data include urban environment, hazardous substances and lifestyle-related exposures for women during pregnancy and their offspring from birth until 6–11 years. Common, standardised protocols were used to collect biological samples, measure exposure biomarkers and omics signatures and assess child health across the six cohorts. Baseline data of the cohort show substantial variation in health outcomes and determinants between the six countries, for example, in family affluence levels, tobacco smoking, physical activity, dietary habits and prevalence of childhood obesity, asthma, allergies and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Future plans HELIX study results will inform on the early life exposome and its association with molecular omics signatures and child health outcomes. Cohort data are accessible for future research involving researchers external to the project.},

  abstract = {The accurate and precise measurement of endogenous corticosteroids in urine is a powerful tool to understand the biochemical state in several diseases. In this study, a rapid, accurate, and sensitive method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) for the quantification of 67 endogenous gluco- and mineralo-corticosteroids and progestins has been developed and validated. Sample preparation, chromatographic separation, and mass spectrometric detection were optimized. Urine samples (0.5mL) were hydrolyzed with β-glucuronidase and the released analytes were extracted by liquid–liquid extraction. The chromatographic separation was performed in 20min after redisolution of the extract. MS behavior of endogenous corticosteroids was evaluated in order to select the most specific precursor ion ([M+H]+, [M+NH4]+, or [M+H-nH2O]+) for the detection. MS/MS determination was performed under selected reaction monitoring mode using electrospray ionization in positive mode. The method was shown to be linear (r{$>$}0.99) in the range of endogenous concentrations for all studied metabolites. Limits of detection (LOD) below 1ngmL−1 were typically obtained for analytes with a 3-oxo-4-ene structure whereas LODs below 15ngmL−1 were common for the rest of analytes. Recoveries were higher than 80\% and intra-assay precisions below 20\%, evaluated at three concentration levels, were found for most steroids. No significant or moderate matrix effect, ranging from 54 to 155\%, was observed for most of the analytes. The applicability of the method was confirmed by analyzing 24h urine samples collected from twenty healthy volunteers and comparing the results with previously established normal ranges. The wide coverage of corticosteroid metabolism, together with short analysis time, low sample volume, simple sample preparation, and satisfactory quantitative results make this method useful for clinical purposes.},

  abstract = {Background A growing body of literature investigated childhood exposure to environmental chemicals in association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, but limited studies considered urinary mixtures of multiple chemical classes. This study examined associations of concurrent exposure to non-persistent chemicals with ADHD symptoms in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental delay, and typical development. Methods A total of 574 children aged 2-5 years from the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) case-control study was administered the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). This study focused on the Hyperactivity subscale and its two subdomains (hyperactivity/impulsivity, inattention). Sixty-two chemicals from four classes (phenols/parabens, phthalates, organophosphate pesticides, trace elements) were quantified in child urine samples, and 43 chemicals detected in {$>$}\,70\% samples were used in statistical analyses. Weighted quantile sum regression for negative binomial outcomes with repeated holdout validation was performed to investigate covariate-adjusted associations between mixtures and ABC scores in 574 children. The mixture analyses were further restricted to 232 children with ASD. Results Phthalate metabolite mixtures, weighted for mono-n-butylphthalate (MNBP), mono-2-heptyl phthalate, and mono-carboxy isononyl phthalate, were associated with the Hyperactivity subscale (mean incidence rate ratio [mIRR]\,=\,1.11; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.00, 1.23), especially the hyperactivity/impulsivity subdomain (mIRR\,=\,1.14; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.06, 1.26). These associations remained similar after restricting to children with ASD. The inattention subdomain was associated with a phenols/parabens mixture, weighted for several parabens and bisphenols (mIRR\,=\,1.13; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.00, 1.28) and a total mixture, weighted for 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid, MNBP, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (mIRR\,=\,1.11; 2.5th, 97.5th percentile: 1.01, 1.25) only among children with ASD. Conclusions Concurrent exposure to phthalate mixtures was associated with hyperactivity in early childhood. Though causal inference cannot be made based on our cross-sectional findings, this study warrants further research on mixtures of larger number of chemicals from multiple classes in association with ADHD-related behaviors in young children.},

  abstract = {Background Investigators measuring exposure biomarkers in urine typically adjust for creatinine to account for dilution-dependent sample variation in urine concentrations. Similarly, it is standard to adjust for serum lipids when measuring lipophilic chemicals in serum. However, there is controversy regarding the best approach, and existing methods may not effectively correct for measurement error. Objectives We compared adjustment methods, including novel approaches, using simulated case–control data. Methods Using a directed acyclic graph framework, we defined six causal scenarios for epidemiologic studies of environmental chemicals measured in urine or serum. The scenarios include variables known to influence creatinine (e.g., age and hydration) or serum lipid levels (e.g., body mass index and recent fat intake). Over a range of true effect sizes, we analyzed each scenario using seven adjustment approaches and estimated the corresponding bias and confidence interval coverage across 1,000 simulated studies. Results For urinary biomarker measurements, our novel method, which incorporates both covariate-adjusted standardization and the inclusion of creatinine as a covariate in the regression model, had low bias and possessed 95\% confidence interval coverage of nearly 95\% for most simulated scenarios. For serum biomarker measurements, a similar approach involving standardization plus serum lipid level adjustment generally performed well. Conclusions To control measurement error bias caused by variations in serum lipids or by urinary diluteness, we recommend improved methods for standardizing exposure concentrations across individuals.

  abstract = {Human brain development is a complex multistep process that is partly coordinated by the endocrine system. Any interference with the endocrine system might affect this process and result in deleterious outcomes. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) represent a large group of exogenous chemicals with the capacity of interfering with endocrine functions. In different population-based settings, associations between exposure to EDCs, particularly in prenatal life, and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes have been demonstrated. These findings are strengthened by numerous experimental studies. Although mechanisms underlying these associations are not entirely delineated, disruption of thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, sex hormone signalling have been shown to be involved. Humans are constantly exposed to mixtures of EDCs, and further research combining epidemiological and experimental settings is required to improve our understanding of the link between real-life exposures to these chemicals and their impact on neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review of the epidemiology literature to identify the neurodevelopmental effects associated with phthalate exposure. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Six phthalates were included in the review: di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The initial literature search (of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline) included all studies of neurodevelopmental effects in humans, and outcomes were selected for full systematic review based on data availability. STUDY EVALUATION AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Studies of neurodevelopmental effects were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for risk of bias and sensitivity by two reviewers using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and phthalate and strength of evidence was summarized using a structured framework. For studies of cognition and motor effects in children ≤4~years old, a random effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: The primary outcomes reviewed here are (number of studies in parentheses): cognition (14), motor effects (9), behavior, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (20), infant behavior (3), and social behavior, including autism spectrum disorder (7). For each phthalate/outcome combination, there was slight or indeterminate evidence of an association, with the exception of motor effects for BBP, which had moderate evidence. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: Overall, there is not a clear pattern of association between prenatal phthalate exposures and neurodevelopment. There are several possible reasons for the observed null associations related to exposure misclassification, periods of heightened susceptibility, sex-specific effects, and the effects of phthalate mixtures. Until these limitations are adequately addressed in the epidemiology literature, these findings should not be interpreted as evidence that there are no neurodevelopmental effects of phthalate exposure.

  abstract = {Environmental stressors, like endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC), are considered important contributors to the increased rates of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. Considering the cumulative research on adverse neurodevelopmental effects associated with prenatal exposure to EDC, the purpose of this study was to review the available limited literature about the effects of postnatal exposure to EDC on child neurodevelopment and behaviour. Despite widespread children's exposure to EDC, there are a limited number of epidemiological studies on the association of this exposure with neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular in the postnatal period. The available research suggests that postnatal EDC exposure is related to adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in children; however the underlying mechanisms of action remain unclear. Timing of exposure is a key factor determining potential neurodevelopmental consequences, hence studying the impact of multiple EDC co-exposure in different vulnerable life periods could guide the identification of sensitive subpopulations. Most of the reviewed studies did not take into account sex differences in the EDC effects on children neurodevelopment. We believe that the inclusion of sex in the study design should be considered as the role of EDC on children neurodevelopment are likely sex-specific and should be taken into consideration when determining susceptibility and potential mechanisms of action.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenol A (BPA) has been associated with impairments in children’s behavior, but few studies have investigated its relationship with cognitive function. Objective To investigate the association of urinary BPA concentrations with cognitive domains and intelligence quotient (IQ) in Spanish boys. Methods BPA levels were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS-MS) in one spot urine sample from 269 boys of the INMA-Granada cohort, in their follow-up at 9–11 years of age. Cognitive function was evaluated by a trained psychologist using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery (including general intelligence, language skills, working memory, attention, impulsivity, visual-motor coordination, processing speed and executive function, among others). Cross-sectional associations between BPA levels and neuropsychological standardized scores were analyzed by adjusted linear and logistic regression models. Results Median (P25, P75) BPA concentrations were 4.76 (2.77, 9.03) μg/L and 4.75 (2.75, 10.2) μg/g of creatinine (Cr). Boys in the third and fourth quartile of volume-based BPA concentrations showed better processing speed scores than boys in the first quartile (β\,=\,5.47; 95\%CI: 1.4, 9.4 and β\,=\,3.57; 95\%CI: -0.4, 7.5, respectively); and boys in the third quartile showed better inhibitory control (β\,=\,1.6; 95\%CI: -0.3, 3.5) and impulsivity (β= -4.2; 95\%CI: -9.0, 0.0). In contrast, boys in the fourth quartile showed poorer working memory scores than those in the first quartile (β= -1.0; 95\%CI: -2.1, -0.1). All these associations were attenuated when Cr-standardized BPA concentrations were considered. Cr-based BPA concentrations were also associated with a higher risk of being below the 20th percentile of working memory scores [ORa\,=\,1.51; 95\%CI: 1.01, 2.25]. Discussion Our findings do not support an association between urinary BPA concentrations and cognitive function or IQ among boys, except for working memory. BPA was previously found to be associated with behavior problems in the same study population, suggesting that BPA may predominantly affect the behavior of children rather than their cognitive function, in line with previous epidemiologic studies.},

There have been extensive cognitive and neuroimaging studies of these networks in adults. We developed an integrated Attention Network Test (ANT) to measure the efficiency of the three networks with adults. We have now adapted this test to study the development of these networks during childhood. The test is a child-friendly version of the flanker task with alerting and orienting cues. We studied the development of the attentional networks in a cross-sectional experiment with four age groups ranging from 6 through 9 (Experiment 1). In a second experiment, we compared children (age 10 years) and adult performance in both child and adults versions of the ANT. Reaction time and accuracy improved at each age interval and positive values were found for the average efficiency of each of the networks. Alertness showed evidence of change up to and beyond age 10, while conflict scores appear stable after age seven and orienting scores do not change in the age range studied. A final experiment with forty 7-year-old children suggested that children like adults showed independence between the three networks under some conditions.},

  abstract = {Results of toxicological studies indicate that phthalates and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), two classes of endocrine disrupting chemicals, may alter the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. We evaluated the associations of urinary phthalate metabolites and serum PFAS during gestation and childhood with adolescent hair cortisol concentrations (pg/mg hair) at age 12 years, an integrative marker of HPA axis activity (n=205 mother-child pairs; Cincinnati, Ohio; enrolled 2003-2006). We used quantile-based g-computation to estimate associations between mixtures of urinary phthalate metabolites or serum PFAS and hair cortisol. We also examined whether associations of individual phthalate metabolites or PFAS with cortisol varied by the timing of exposure. We found that a quartile increase in all childhood phthalate metabolites was associated with 35\% higher adolescent hair cortisol (phthalate mixture ψ=0.13; 95\% CI=0.03, 0.22); these associations were driven by MEP, MiBP and MBzP. We did not find evidence that phthalate metabolites during gestation or serum PFAS mixtures were related to adolescent hair cortisol concentrations. We found suggestive evidence that higher childhood concentrations of individual PFAS were related to higher and lower adolescent hair cortisol concentrations. Our results suggest that phthalate exposure during childhood may contribute to higher levels of chronic HPA axis activity.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common childhood neurobehavioral disorder. Studies suggest that prenatal and early childhood exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be associated with ADHD, but the association during adolescence has not been studied to date.To evaluate the association between exposure to select endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence and ADHD-related behaviors.For this cross-sectional analysis, data were collected from 205 adolescents in the New Bedford Cohort, an ongoing prospective birth cohort, between June 18, 2011, and June 10, 2014. The adolescents provided spot urine samples and underwent neurodevelopmental testing. Statistical analyses performed from January 15 to December 31, 2019, used a repeated-measures analysis with multivariate modified Poisson models to estimate the adjusted relative risk of ADHD-related behaviors associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals.Urinary biomarker concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals or their metabolites, including phthalates, parabens, phenols, and triclocarban, were quantified. Summary exposure measures were created, combining biomarker concentrations of chemicals with a shared mechanism of action, exposure pathway, or chemical class.Behaviors related to ADHD were assessed with up to 14 indices from self-, parent-, and teacher-completed behavioral checklists using validated and standardized instruments; specifically, the Conners Attention Deficit Scale and the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. Scores on each index were dichotomized to identify those with evidence of a significant behavioral problem, defined by each scale’s interpretive guidelines.Among the 205 participants, the mean (SD) age at assessment was 15.3 (0.7) years, with 112 girls (55\%) and 124 non-Hispanic White participants (61\%). The median urine concentrations were 0.45 μmol/L of Σantiandrogenic phthalates, 0.13 μmol/L of ΣDEHP metabolites, 0.49 μmol/L of Σpersonal care product phthalates, 0.35 μmol/L of Σparabens, 0.02 μmol/L of Σbisphenols, and 0.02 μmol/L of Σdichlorophenols. A total of 82 (40\%) had scores consistent with a significant behavioral problem, whereas 39 (19\%) had an ADHD diagnosis. Each 2-fold increase in the sum of antiandrogenic phthalate concentrations was associated with a 1.34 (95\% CI, 1.00-1.79) increase in the risk of significant ADHD-related behavior problems, whereas a 2-fold increase in the sum of dichlorophenols was associated with a 1.15 (95\% CI, 1.01-1.32) increased risk. These associations tended to be stronger in male participants, but comparisons of sex-specific differences were imprecise.Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are used in a wide variety of consumer products resulting in ubiquitous exposure. The study findings suggest that exposure to some of these chemicals, particularly certain phthalates, during adolescence may be associated with behaviors characteristic of ADHD.},

  abstract = {Background Inflammation is associated with cognitive functioning and dementia in older adults, but whether inflammation is related to cognitive functioning in youth and whether these associations are causal remains unclear. Methods In a population-based cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; ALSPAC), we investigated cross-sectional associations of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], Interleukin-6 [IL-6] and Glycoprotein acetyls [GlycA]) with measures of cold (working memory, response inhibition) and hot (emotion recognition) cognition at age 24 (N~=~3,305 in multiple imputation models). Furthermore, we conducted one-sample and two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to examine potential causal effects of genetically-proxied inflammatory markers (CRP, GlycA, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, soluble IL-6 receptor) on cognitive measures (above) and on general cognitive ability. Results In the ALSPAC cohort, there was limited evidence of an association between standardised inflammatory markers and standardised cognitive measures at age 24 after adjusting for potential confounders (N~=~3,305; beta range, −0.02 [95~\% confidence interval (CI) −0.06 to 0.02, p~=~0.27] to 0.02 [95~\% CI −0.02 to 0.05, p~=~0.33]). Similarly, we found limited evidence of potential effects of 1-unit increase in genetically-proxied inflammatory markers on standardised working memory, emotion recognition or response inhibition in one-sample MR using ALSPAC data (beta range, −0.73 [95~\% CI −2.47 to 1.01, p~=~0.41] to 0.21 [95~\% CI −1.42 to 1.84, p~=~0.80]; or on standardised general cognitive ability in two-sample MR using the latest Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) datasets (inverse-variance weighted beta range, −0.02 [95~\% CI −0.05 to 0.01, p~=~0.12] to 0.03 [95~\% CI −0.01 to 0.07, p~=~0.19]). Conclusions Our MR findings do not provide strong evidence of a potential causal effect of inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-6 receptor, GlycA) on the cognitive functions examined here. Given the large confidence intervals in the one-sample MR, larger GWAS of specific cognitive measures are needed to enable well-powered MR analyses to investigate whether inflammation causally influences specific cognitive domains.},

However, the evidence of the effects of prenatal phthalate exposure across pregnancy on fetal glucocorticoids was insufficient. Objective We investigated the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites across pregnancy and cord blood glucocorticoids in a prospective birth cohort. Methods Our study included 553 mother-infant pairs from a prospective birth cohort conducted in Wuhan, China. Maternal urine samples were collected at 14, 24 and 36\,weeks of gestation (mean). Urinary phthalate metabolites and cord blood glucocorticoids (cortisol and cortisone) were measured. Generalized estimating equation models were conducted to explore the relationships of phthalate metabolite concentrations at each trimester and glucocorticoid levels. Results Among the participants, mono‑benzyl phthalate (MBzP) in the first trimester was associated with higher cortisol/cortisone ratio concentrations, and mono‑(2‑ethyl‑5‑carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) and mono‑(2‑ethyl‑5‑oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) measured in the third trimester were associated with decreased cortisone. Moreover, the associations between phthalates and glucocorticoids varied by sex. Among the female infants, each 10-fold increase in several maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in 1st and 3rd trimester was associated with the increased glucocorticoid levels with percent changes ranged from 16.2\%–55.9\%. However, among male infants, each 10-fold increase in maternal urinary MECPP, mono‑(2‑ethyl‑5‑hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and MEOHP in 3rd trimester was associated with 20.8\%–36.3\% decreased cortisol and cortisone levels, respectively. Conclusion We have shown that prenatal phthalate exposure during early and late trimester disrupted the infant steroidogenesis and these associations might be modified by infant sex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate phthalate exposure at three trimesters during pregnancy in relation to infant glucocorticoids.},

Chronic traffic air pollution (elemental carbon [EC], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ultrafine particle number [UFP; 10–700 nm]) was measured twice during 1-wk campaigns both in the courtyard (outdoor) and inside the classroom (indoor) simultaneously in each school pair. Cognitive development was assessed with the n-back and the attentional network tests, in particular, working memory (two-back detectability), superior working memory (three-back detectability), and inattentiveness (hit reaction time standard error). Linear mixed effects models were adjusted for age, sex, maternal education, socioeconomic status, and air pollution exposure at home. Children from highly polluted schools had a smaller growth in cognitive development than children from the paired lowly polluted schools, both in crude and adjusted models (e.g., 7.4\% [95\% CI 5.6\%–8.8\%] versus 11.5\% [95\% CI 8.9\%–12.5\%] improvement in working memory, p = 0.0024). Cogently, children attending schools with higher levels of EC, NO2, and UFP both indoors and outdoors experienced substantially smaller growth in all the cognitive measurements; for example, a change from the first to the fourth quartile in indoor EC reduced the gain in working memory by 13.0\% (95\% CI 4.2\%–23.1\%). Residual confounding for social class could not be discarded completely; however, the associations remained in stratified analyses (e.g., for type of school or high-/low-polluted area) and after additional adjustments (e.g., for commuting, educational quality, or smoking at home), contradicting a potential residual confounding explanation. Conclusions Children attending schools with higher traffic-related air pollution had a smaller improvement in cognitive development.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenol A (BPA) has been linked to changes in the dopamine system and development of an Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) phenotype in animal models, with differing effects in males compared to females. We examined the association between urinary BPA concentrations and ADHD in a national sample of U.S. children, and whether this association differs by child sex. Methods We used data from the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of the U.S. population. Participants were 8-15 years of age (N=460). Using a diagnostic interview to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the past year, multivariable logistic regression examined the link between concurrent urinary BPA concentrations and ADHD status. Results Of the 460 participants, 7.1\% [95\% CI: 4.4–11.3] met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. Children who had BPA concentrations at or above the median of the sample had higher prevalence of meeting criteria for ADHD (11.2\% [95\% CI: 6.8–17.8]) than those with BPA concentrations below the median (2.9\% [95\% CI: 1.1–7.2]). Higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with ADHD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.68 [95\% CI: 1.6–19.8] for BPA concentrations above vs. below the median). In sex-stratified analyses, these associations were stronger in boys (aOR=10.9 [95\% CI: 1.4–86.0]) than in girls (aOR=2.8 [95\% CI: 0.4–21.3]), although the BPA by sex interaction term was not significant (p=0.25). Conclusion We found evidence that higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with ADHD in U.S. children; these associations were stronger in boys than in girls. Considering the widespread use of BPA and growing literature on neurobehavioral effects of BPA in children, further study is warranted to determine if reducing exposure to BPA may represent an important avenue for ADHD prevention.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which offer systematic representations of causal relationships, have become an established framework for the analysis of causal inference in epidemiology, often being used to determine covariate adjustment sets for minimizing confounding bias. DAGitty is a popular web application for drawing and analysing DAGs. Here we introduce the R package ‘dagitty’, which provides access to all of the capabilities of the DAGitty web application within the R platform for statistical computing, and also offers several new functions. We describe how the R package ‘dagitty’ can be used to: evaluate whether a DAG is consistent with the dataset it is intended to represent; enumerate ‘statistically equivalent’ but causally different DAGs; and identify exposure-outcome adjustment sets that are valid for causally different but statistically equivalent DAGs. This functionality enables epidemiologists to detect causal misspecifications in DAGs and make robust inferences that remain valid for a range of different DAGs. The R package ‘dagitty’ is available through the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN) at [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/]. The source code is available on github at [https://github.com/jtextor/dagitty].

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to chemical mixtures is recognized as the real-life scenario in all populations, needing new statistical methods that can assess their complex effects. Objectives: We aimed to assess the joint effect of in utero exposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on children’s neurodevelopment. Methods: We employed a novel statistical approach, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), to study the joint effect of coexposure to arsenic, manganese, and lead on neurodevelopment using an adapted Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development™. Third Edition, in 825 mother–child pairs recruited into a prospective birth cohort from two clinics in the Pabna and Sirajdikhan districts of Bangladesh. Metals were measured in cord blood using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results: Analyses were stratified by clinic due to differences in exposure profiles. In the Pabna district, which displayed high manganese levels [interquartile range (IQR): 4.8,  18μg/dl 18 μ g / dl ], we found a statistically significant negative effect of the mixture of arsenic, lead, and manganese on cognitive score when cord blood metals concentrations were all above the 60th percentile ( As≥0.7μg/dl As ≥ 0.7 μ g / dl ,  Mn≥6.6μg/dl Mn ≥ 6.6 μ g / dl ,  Pb≥4.2μg/dl Pb ≥ 4.2 μ g / dl ) compared to the median ( As=0.5μg/dl As = 0.5 μ g / dl ,  Mn=5.8μg/dl Mn = 5.8 μ g / dl ,  Pb=3.1μg/dl Pb = 3.1 μ g / dl ). Evidence of a nonlinear effect of manganese was found. A change in log manganese from the 25th to the 75th percentile when arsenic and manganese were at the median was associated with a decrease in cognitive score of  −0.3 − 0.3  ( −0.5 − 0.5 ,  −0.1 − 0.1 ) standard deviations. Our study suggests that arsenic might be a potentiator of manganese toxicity. Conclusions: Employing a novel statistical method for the study of the health effects of chemical mixtures, we found evidence of neurotoxicity of the mixture, as well as potential synergism between arsenic and manganese. https://doi-org.sare.upf.edu/10.1289/EHP614},

  abstract = {Background Phthalates are endocrine disrupters used in a variety of consumer products. Human studies suggest an association between phthalate exposure and cognitive development but adverse effects of the recently introduced phthalate substitutes have only been sparsely studied. Objectives To investigate associations between prenatal and concurrent exposure to phthalates and IQ in 7-year-old children from the Odense Child Cohort. Methods Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort had phthalate metabolites measured in urine samples during 3rd trimester in 2010 to 2012. In addition, phthalates were also measured in urine samples from their offspring at age 7~years. IQ was assessed at age 7~years using four subtests from Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. The total study population consisted of 585 mother-child pairs with available prenatal urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations and IQ data at age 7~years. A subset of those (N~=~274) had urinary phthalate metabolites measured in child urine at age 7~years. Phthalate concentrations were grouped into tertiles and associations with IQ were investigated using multiple linear regression adjusting for sex, maternal education and maternal/child BMI. Results Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations both in pregnant women and children were generally lower compared to previous cohorts. Children with high prenatal urinary concentrations of MEP and metabolites of DEHP (∑DEHPm)(3rd tertile) had −3.1 (95\% CI: −5.5, −0.6) (MEP) and~−~3.0 (−5.5, −0.6) (∑DEHPm) IQ points at age 7~years compared to children with low concentrations (1st tertile). High concurrent urinary phthalate concentrations of MCPP, ∑DnHxPm, ∑DiDPm and ∑DiNPm in the 3rd tertile was associated with −3.7 (−7.2, −0.2), −4.4 (−7.9, −0.9), −3.7 (−7.2, −0.2) and~−~5.6 (−9.1, −2.2) IQ points, respectively, compared to those with the lowest concentrations (1st tertile). Conclusion We found significant inverse associations between some prenatal and concurrent urinary phthalate concentrations and IQ at age 7~years in this low exposed population. This suggests that exposure to phthalates both prenatally and during early childhood could be hazardous to child neurodevelopment, however, large-scale prospective studies assessing phthalate exposure through multiple urine samples, and possibly investigating cocktail effects of the chemicals as well as long term follow-up are warranted.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental periods in early life may be particularly vulnerable to impacts of environmental exposures. Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure-health effect relationships. The "exposome" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. OBJECTIVES: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the "early-life exposome." Here we describe the general design of the project. METHODS: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. CONCLUSIONS: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.},

  abstract = {Intelligence predicts important life and health outcomes, but the biological mechanisms underlying differences in intelligence are not yet understood. The use of genetically determined metabotypes (GDMs) to understand the role of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions, in human complex traits has been recently proposed. However, this strategy has not been applied to human intelligence. Here we implemented a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using GDMs to assess the causal relationships between genetically determined metabolites and human intelligence. The standard inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was used for the primary MR analysis and three additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO) were used for sensitivity analyses. Using 25 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), our study found that 5-oxoproline was associated with better performance in human intelligence tests (PIVW = 9.25 × 10–5). The causal relationship was robust when sensitivity analyses were applied (PMR-Egger = 0.0001, PWeighted median = 6.29 × 10–6, PMR-PRESSO = 0.0007), and repeated analysis yielded consistent result (PIVW = 0.0087). Similarly, also dihomo-linoleate (20:2n6) and p-acetamidophenylglucuronide showed robust association with intelligence. Our study provides novel insight by integrating genomics and metabolomics to estimate causal effects of genetically determined metabolites on human intelligence, which help to understanding of the biological mechanisms related to human intelligence.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is male predominated, and the etiology of this disorder remains unclear. Past studies have assessed the association of low-level organophosphate pesticide exposure with childhood ADHD cross-sectionally and prospectively. However, the results have been inconsistent. A first case–control study was performed to investigate the relationship between organophosphate pesticide exposure and ADHD with adjusted covariates. We recruited 97 doctor-diagnosed ADHD cases and 110 non-ADHD controls who were 4–15 years of age. Exposure was assessed using urinary levels of dialkylphosphate metabolites, which are biomarkers of OP pesticide exposure. Blood lead levels and polymorphisms of two commonly verified dopaminergic-related genes (the D4 dopamine receptor gene DRD4 and the dopamine transporter gene DAT1) were also analyzed. The sociodemographics and lifestyles of the children and of the mothers during pregnancy were collected using a questionnaire. The blood lead levels of both groups were similar (1.57 ± 0.73 vs. 1.73 ± 0.77 μg/dL, p = 0.15). Significant urinary concentration differences in one of the six dialkylphosphate metabolites, dimethylphosphate (DMP), were found between ADHD and control subjects (322.92 ± 315.68 vs. 224.37 ± 156.58 nmol/g cr., p {$<$} 0.01). A dose–response relationship was found between urinary concentrations of DMP and ADHD in both crude and adjusted analyses (p for trend{$<$}0.05). Children with higher urinary DMP concentrations may have a twofold to threefold increased risk of being diagnosed with ADHD. We report a dose–response relationship between child DMP levels and ADHD. Organophosphate pesticide exposure may have deleterious effects on children's neurodevelopment, particularly the development of ADHD.},
