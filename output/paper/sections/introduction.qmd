The prevalence of several neurodevelopmental disorders has increased in the pediatric population [@GrandjeanLandrigan:2014], and multiple environmental pollutants play a role in the increased rates of these disorders [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022]. \acr{edcs}, chemicals that are capable of interfering with the endocrine system, have been shown to have a role in childhood neurodevelopment [@Braun:2017]. Although both pregnancy and early childhood are crucial stages of (neuro)development, most of the available literature is focused on the effects of prenatal exposure to \acr{edcs} on child neurodevelopment [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022]. Moreover, little is known about the biological mechanisms of action [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022].

\acr{opps} might have a deleterious effect on neurodevelopment, although the few studies conducted on children and using a biological matrix for exposure assessment suffered from a series of limitations, including a small sample size and few \acr{opp} metabolites measured [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022]. Phthalates and their metabolites have been associated to several adverse effects on neurodevelopment [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022]. Similarly, these studies focused on few phthalates metabolites and were conducted in small populations. On the other hand, the effects of exposure to \acr{bpa} on cognitive functions are still unclear [@RamirezGalvez-OntiverosGonzalez-Domenech:2022].

Another major limitation of these epidemiological studies, especially when non-persistent chemicals are analyzed, is the reliance on single-spot urine samples for exposure assessment, which might not be representative of long-term exposures.

Something about corticosteroids...

In the present study, we estimated associations between 1) non-persistent \acr{edcs} and attention, 2) non-persistent \acr{edcs} and corticosteroids, and 3) corticosteroids and attention, using the parametric g-formula and average contrasts, in children of a large prospective birth cohort in Europe.
