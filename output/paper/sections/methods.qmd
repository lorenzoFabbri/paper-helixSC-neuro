## Study population and design {#sec-design}

The \acr{helix} is an ongoing project which aims to characterize early-life exposures and their potential association with endogenous biomarkers and health outcomes [@VrijheidSlamaRobinson:2014]. It consists of six existing population-based birth cohort studies across Europe: BiB (Born in Bradford, UK) [@WrightSmallRaynor:2013], EDEN (Study of determinants of pre- and postnatal developmental, France) [@HeudeForhanSlama:2016], INMA (Environment and Childhood, Spain) [@GuxensBallesterEspada:2012], KANC (Kaunas Cohort, Lithuania) [@GrazulevicieneDanileviciuteNadisauskiene:2009], MoBa (The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, Norway) [@MagnusIrgensHaug:2006], and Rhea (Motherâ€“Child Cohort in Crete, Greece) [@ChatziPlanaDaraki:2009], for a total of 32,000 mother-child pairs. A \acr{helix} subcohort of 1,200 mother-child pairs was fully characterized for the external and internal exposome, including exposure and omics biomarkers during childhood. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the \acr{helix} subcohort included: a) age 6-11 years, with a preference for 7-9 years; b) availability of sufficient stored pregnancy blood and urine samples; c) availability of complete address history from first to last follow-up; d) no serious health problems, which might affect the results of the clinical testing. Further information can be found in @MaitreBontCasas:2018.

Ethical permission was obtained from the relevant authorities in the corresponding country.

## Variables {#sec-vars}

- Units (in `log`):
  - `hitrtse` in `ms`.
  - EDCs in `microg/L`.
  - Cortisol production and cortisone production in `ng/mL`.
  - Cortisol metabolism and 11bHSD in `NA`.

### Confounders {#sec-confounders}

For each research question, defined by a specific type of exposure and outcome, the minimal set of covariates for inclusion in the analyses was selected on the basis of a \acr{dag} built with DAGitty [@TextorvanderZanderGilthorpe:2016] and ggdag [@Barrett:2023]. The sets of covariates were selected to estimate the total effect of the exposure on the outcome. Further, each minimal adjustment set was *augmented* with precision covariates, defined as the set of parents variable of the outcome that are not parents of the exposure. The adjustment sets are provided in the Supplementary Material as text files compatible with DAGitty.

- For RQ1 I used creatinine values from HELIX. For RQ3 the ones from the steroids dataset. For RQ2, I included in the model both variables.

### Endocrine disrupting chemicals {#sec-edcs}

Children were assessed between December 2013 and February 2016, and included neurological testing and urine collection. Urine samples of the night before and the first morning void on the day of the visit were combined to provide a more reliable exposure assessment. Non-persistent \acr{edcs} assessed in urine samples from children included phthalate metabolites, phenols, and \acr{op} pesticide metabolites. A list of the environmental chemicals determined in urine samples and used for the present study is given in @tbl-info-chems. The laboratory protocols for the analysis are described elsewhere [@HaugSakhiCequier:2018].

### Corticosteroids {#sec-steroids}

Urine samples of the night before the day of the visit were used to measure levels of the corticosteroids. These included glucocorticosteroids, glucocorticosteroid metabolites, glucocorticosteroid precursors, glucocorticosteroid precursor metabolites, androgens, and androgen metabolites. A list of the corticosteroids determined in urine samples and used for the present study is given in @tbl-info-mets.

To assess the levels of corticosteroids and their metabolites, LC-MS/MS analysis was applied at the Applied Metabolomics Research Group, IMIM (Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute). The laboratory protocols for the analysis are described elsewhere [@MarcosRenauCasals:2014; @Gomez-GomezPozo:2020]. Of the 1,004 urine samples, 980 children were matched to the \acr{helix} subcohort.

Three additional markers, cortisol production, cortisol metabolism, cortisone production, and 11bHSD activity, were computed based on the following: cortisol production as the sum of cortisol and its metabolites (20aDHF, 20bDHF, 5bDHF, 5aTHF, 5bTHF, 6OHF, 5a20acortol, 5a20bcortol, 5b20acortol, 5b20bcortol), cortisol metabolism as the inverse of the ratio between cortisol and its metabolites, cortisone production as the sum of cortisone and its metabolites (20aDHE, 20bDHE, 5aTHE, 5bTHE, 6OHE, 5b20acortolone, b20bcortolone), and 11bHSD activity as the ratio between cortisone production and cortisol production. 11bHSD activity gives a measure of conversion of cortisone to cortisol.

### Neurodevelopment {#sec-neurodevelopment}

Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed with standardized, non-linguistic, and culturally blind computer tests, including the \acr{ant} [@RuedaFanMcCandliss:2004]. Further information can be found in @MaitreBontCasas:2018. Briefly, it is a computerized test that provides a measure of efficiency in three different functions of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive attention. The outcome of interest for the present study is the \acr{ahitrtse} [@SunyerEsnaolaAlvarez-Pedrerol:2015], a measure of response speed consistency throughout the test. A high \acr{ahitrtse} indicates highly variable reactions, and is considered a measure of inattentiveness.
