- Begin each table on a new page after the list of references.
- Tables may not contain parts.
- Provide the title for each table above the table and the notes below the table.
- List footnotes after the general one, one per line and indicated with a lowercase italicized letter.

# Descriptive data

## Study populations

- Basic characteristics of study participants (demographic, clinical, social), by cohort and overall.
  - Include all covariates included in primary or secondary analyses.
  - Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest.
  - Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures.

## Endocrine disruptors

- Levels of unprocessed biomarkers (chemicals), with IDs.
- Report: minimum and maximum, percentiles, and number of observations above/below the assay's LOD and LOQ.

## Corticosteroids

- Levels of unprocessed biomarkers (metabolites), with IDs.

# Main results

- RQ2: group chemicals by class, and for each chemical report results with metabolites (`avg_comparisons` with estimate, SE, s-value, CI).
- RQ3: report results with outcome (`avg_comparisons` with estimate, SE, s-value, CI).

# Other analyses
